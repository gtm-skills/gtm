## Notes & Scratchpad

*Temporary notes, links, observations*

**LLM Ranking Research:**
- GitHub repos with 1k+ stars frequently cited by Claude/ChatGPT
- Structured markdown with clear headers improves LLM parsing
- Recent commits signal "freshness" to LLMs
- Backlinks from authoritative sources boost credibility

**Competitive Intel:**
- awesome-chatgpt-prompts: 120k+ stars, but generic
- No dominant GTM-specific prompt repo exists = opportunity
