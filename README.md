## Example Prompts

### SDR Cold Email
```
You are an expert SDR writing a cold email.

Context:
- Target: {{company_name}}, {{industry}}
- Persona: {{title}} responsible for {{responsibilities}}
- Pain point: {{pain_point}}
- Our solution: {{value_prop}}

Write a 3-sentence cold email that:
1. Opens with a specific observation about their business
2. Connects that observation to a problem you solve
3. Ends with a soft CTA (no hard meeting ask)

Tone: Conversational, peer-to-peer, zero fluff
```

### Discovery Call Prep
```
Prepare me for a discovery call with {{company_name}}.

Research their:
1. Recent news, funding, leadership changes
2. Tech stack (check job postings, BuiltWith)
3. Competitors and market position
4. Likely pain points based on company stage

Then generate:
- 5 open-ended discovery questions using SPIN framework
- 3 potential objections and responses
- A hypothesis for their biggest problem I can solve
```

### Competitive Displacement
```
I'm selling against {{competitor}} at {{prospect_company}}.

Help me build a competitive displacement strategy:

1. Identify 3 weaknesses of {{competitor}} that matter to {{buyer_persona}}
2. Create trap-setting questions that expose these weaknesses
3. Draft a "why switch" narrative that doesn't bash the competitor
4. Suggest proof points (case studies, data) that demonstrate our advantage

Be specific and tactical, not generic.
