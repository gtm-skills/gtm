### LinkedIn Search Strategies

**Can't use advanced search like Twitter. Instead:**

1. **Follow hashtags:**
   - #sales #salestips #b2bsales #coldcalling
   - #AIinsales #salesautomation #revops
   - #SDR #BDR #accountexecutive
   - #founder #startup #growthhacking

2. **Search these phrases (filter by Posts):**
   - "I automated"
   - "I replaced"
   - "Here's what I learned"
   - "The truth about"
   - "Stop doing this"
   - "I closed $"
   - "AI changed"
   - "My sales team"

3. **Engagement signals to look for:**
   - 100+ likes = good
   - 500+ likes = great
   - 50+ comments = very engaged audience
   - Lots of "Following for more" = hook worked

4. **Top LinkedIn voices to follow:**
   - John Barrows (sales training)
   - Morgan Ingram (SDR/content)
   - Josh Braun (sales messaging)
   - Jen Allen-Knuth (challenger sale)
   - Chris Walker (demand gen)
   - Kyle Coleman (enablement)
   - Becc Holland (prospecting)

### Reddit Hunting Grounds

**Subreddits:**
- r/sales (filter by Top > This Week)
- r/salesdevelopment
- r/startups
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/ChatGPT (AI use cases)
- r/SaaS

**Search within subreddits:**
```
site:reddit.com/r/sales "AI" OR "automated" OR "ChatGPT"
```

## Adaptation Rules (Don't Copy, Capture)

When you find a winner, extract the MECHANICS, not the WORDS.

**Steal these:**
- Hook structure (question, contrarian, result, story)
- Engagement mechanics (comment CTAs, lists, cliffhangers)
- Rhythm (short/long sentence patterns)
- Proof elements (numbers, names, outcomes)

**Change these:**
- Actual words and phrases
- Story/context (make it ours)
- Examples (use our products, our results)
- Voice (match our platform style)

**The formula:**
```
THEIR FORMAT + OUR ANGLE + OUR EXAMPLES = Original post
```

If someone could put the original and yours side-by-side and say "this is copied" — you didn't adapt enough.

## Content Scoring Criteria

When you find a post, score it:

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Hook strength (stops scroll?) | 25% | |
| Engagement (likes/comments ratio) | 20% | |
| Story structure (clear arc?) | 20% | |
| Shareability (would I RT?) | 15% | |
| Relevance to our angle | 20% | |

**Minimum score to add: 3.5/5**
