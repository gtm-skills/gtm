## ICP Building

### Define ICP from Scratch

```
Help me define my Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for [PRODUCT/SERVICE].

What I know:
- What we sell: [DESCRIPTION]
- Problem we solve: [PAIN POINT]
- Best customers so far: [DESCRIBE 2-3]
- Customers that struggled: [DESCRIBE 1-2]

Build an ICP including:
1. Company characteristics (industry, size, stage, tech)
2. Situational triggers (what makes them ready to buy)
3. Champion profile (who buys, their role and traits)
4. Negative filters (who NOT to target)
5. Qualifying questions to confirm fit
```

### ICP from Best Customers

```
Analyze my best customers and identify patterns:

Customer 1: [COMPANY, SIZE, INDUSTRY, HOW THEY USE US]
Customer 2: [COMPANY, SIZE, INDUSTRY, HOW THEY USE US]
Customer 3: [COMPANY, SIZE, INDUSTRY, HOW THEY USE US]

Tell me:
1. Common company characteristics
2. Common situation when they bought
3. Common persona who championed
4. Common objections they had
5. What made them successful with us

Then synthesize into ICP criteria.
```

### ICP Negative Signals

```
Based on this ICP: [YOUR ICP DESCRIPTION]

List the negative signals that indicate a bad fit:

1. Company characteristics to avoid
2. Timing signals that mean "not now"
3. Persona red flags
4. Things they say that indicate misalignment
5. Behaviors during sales process that predict failure

Be specific so I can disqualify faster.
