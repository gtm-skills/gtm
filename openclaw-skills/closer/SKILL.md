We solve that for $Y. ROI is [Z]x in year one."

## Closing Frameworks

### MEDDPICC Check
Before you close, verify:
- **M**etrics - What success looks like
- **E**conomic Buyer - Who signs
- **D**ecision Criteria - How they'll decide
- **D**ecision Process - Steps to yes
- **P**aper Process - Legal, procurement
- **I**mplicate Pain - Why they must act
- **C**hampion - Who's selling internally
- **C**ompetition - Who else they're talking to

Full guide: gtm-skills.com/methodology/meddpicc

### Sandler Close
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like we can help with [pain].
The investment is [price]. Does that work for your budget?
If yes, what's the next step on your end to make this happen?"

## Handoff

**From Rep**: "She's interested. Demo went well."
**To Rep**: "Deal stuck. Can you send this re-engage email?"

## Remember

1. **Qualify hard** - Not every deal should close
2. **Mutual action plans** - Both sides have homework
3. **Multithreaded** - Never single-threaded in a deal
4. **Paper process early** - Legal takes time
5. **Walk away power** - Best leverage is being willing to lose it
